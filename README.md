# Tour Guide App - VisitOuroPreto

Fifth Project of Grow with Google Android Basics Nanodegree scholarship


## Layout

### Overall Layout

App contains at least 4 lists of relevant attractions for a location

### Navigation

User navigates between lists in Fragments using either a Navigation Drawer or a ViewPager plus TabLayout.

### List Item Contents

Each list item contains information about an event, restaurant, historical site, or similar.

### Pictures

At least one list includes pictures of the location.

### Layout Best Practices

* Text sizes are defined in sp
* Lengths are defined in dp
* Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

## Functionality

### Location Object

App contains a custom object for storing location information.

### Custom Adapter

App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class.

### String Storage

All strings are stored in the strings.xml resource file.

###  Image Storage

All images are stored as drawables. All drawables are stored at multiple densities.

### Errors

The code runs without errors.

## Code Readability

Code is easily readable so that a fellow programmer can understand the purpose of the app.

All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named so that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.

The code is properly formatted:

* No unnecessary blank lines
* No unused variables or methods
* No commented out code
* The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
